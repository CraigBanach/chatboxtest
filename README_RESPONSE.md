## Things to mention

Response is using markdown, there's probably a way to prevent this coming back from OpenAI

## Further Improvements

With additional time, for a production application, I'd make these additional improvements:

- Currently the response is in markdown format, but the chatbot only displays plain text. Either improve the chat UI to display markdown or force the AI to return only plain text responses
